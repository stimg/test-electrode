Use electrode lib for the application.
> "Electrode is a platform for building universal React/Node.js applications with standardized structure, best practices, and modern technologies baked in. Electrode focuses on performance, component reusability, and simple deployment to multiple cloud providersâ€”so you can focus on what makes your app unique."

Use electrode electrify to visualize the sizes of node modules and assets:

This is a great tool for code optimization and performance improvements in the big applications.

## Project structure and modularization

### Elements of the enterprise architecture

1. Container (Docker) -- contains everything you need for development.
2. CI / CD (Travis) -- checks you code fro errors.
3. NPM Modules
4. State management -- Redux
5. SSR -- server-side rendering, improve performance
6. PWA -- progressive web app, offer capabilities like native apps (offline, push messages)
7. Testing an linting (Jest, Mocha, Karma, ESLint)

### Project organization
I. By types of files:
   - Components
   - Actions
   - Reducers
   - ...

II. By features or functions:
   - Contact List --> Component, Actions, Reducers, ...
   - Company list --> Component, Actions, Reducers, ...
   - Add new contact -->  Component, Actions, Reducers, ...
   - ...

III. Lifting state up:
```
                                                  |--- props ---> Component
 Contact List --> Container (State connection) -->|--- props ---> Component
                                                  |--- props ---> Component                                
```

### Modules with NPM packages.

You can create a separate NPM packages for some part of your code, publish them to the npmjs.org and use it in your projects. There are public and private modules.

### Docker containers

Use Docker containers with the preinstalled environmment to be sure you app development can be performed on any OS.

## Application management

### State management
Use Redux or MobX to manage application state.

**Redux** promotes the use of functional programming, immutability, one store, and unit directional data flow.

**MobX** promotes the use of object-oriented programming, mutable state, which is the opposite of Redux, and observables to sync data. 

You can also use Redux with Thunk or Saga.

With Thunk, you can do this, but unfortunately, there is the issue of side effects which goes against the goal of Redux and its pure functional approach.

**Redux-Saga** Library was built to support needs like API calls and make them predictable. 

You could use Thunk if you prefer a simpler approach and do not need the benefits of Saga, but as we're talking about a growing application where actions become much more involved, Saga is a better choice. 

### Testing

Use Jest, Mocha, Enzym, Chai.

Use Travis CI (http://travis-ci.org) to set up autmatical testing when you change code and make pushes into the repository.
